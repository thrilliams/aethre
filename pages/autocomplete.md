# Autocomplete
This is a program I wrote to guess what a user might be typing based on a set of search history as described in the file [history_template.txt](https://github.com/thrilliams/autocomplete/blob/master/history_template.txt). This was an assignment for a [Hello World](https://helloworldstudio.org) camp.
