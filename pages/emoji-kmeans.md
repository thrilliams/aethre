# Emoji K-Means Clustering
A program to do K-Means clustering on quantified values of emoji. This was an assignment for a [Hello World](https://helloworldstudio.org) camp. The data for the emoji in [emoji.txt](https://github.com/thrilliams/emoji-kmeans/blob/master/emoji.txt) was not gathered by me, that was someone else.
