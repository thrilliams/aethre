# KLS TWOW
TWOW stands for Ten Words Of Wisdom. It is a game in which contestants answer a (usually funny) prompt in as close to ten words as possible. Then, everyone votes on which ones they think are the best. This project was a semi-automated website to let students at KLS vote and respond for our own competition.
